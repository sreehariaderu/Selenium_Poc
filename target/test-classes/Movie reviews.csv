1,"Kannappa portrays the spiritual transformation of Thinnan, a hunter and atheist, into a devout Shiva worshipper. Actor Vishnu Manchu portrays both the title character and Arjuna from the Mahabharata, delivering a compelling performance and bringing the reincarnation arc to life with powerful screen presence."
2,Though there are many shortages..i like the concept which was neved kept before audience. .they have tried to keep it before audience. ..for dat 8 stars.. Costumes of heroine was too modern .
3,"What a performance, boss! I walked into the theatre with zero expectations, honestly a bit worried about how the true story of Kannappa might be handled - and also unsure about Prabhas' role. But man, you absolutely nailed it! While the set pieces could've been better, your acting in the second half, especially the emotional scenes with Prabhas and Mohan Babu, were totally worth every penny. You moved us all to tears by the end. 😭"
4,"This movie is great-like, unbelievably great. You'll totally get it once you watch it... or maybe you won't. We already know the story, but don't worry-they've managed to throw in some ""surprises"" that'll leave you shocked..."
5,"One of the best movie seen in recent time. This being a Hindu mythological story, this needs to be imparted to next generation children. Depicts highest, pure form of devotion to lord Siva."
6,"In Kannappa, a mythological epic rooted in devotion and transformation, Prabhas makes a striking impact as Rudra, a divine embodiment of cosmic power and spiritual guidance. Though his screen time is limited to just over 17 minutes, his presence is anything but fleeting. In fact, it is Prabhas' portrayal of Rudra that injects the film with a sense of gravitas and mysticism, elevating the narrative beyond its mortal arc."
7,"""KANNAPPA"" (2025), a Telugu-language mythological devotional film directed by Mukesh Kumar Singh, attempts to portray the life of Kannappa, a devoted follower of Lord Shiva."
8,I dont know why people are review bombing this movie so badly. Its not as bad as people are complaining. It was a very decent movie and every actor gave their best efforts including Manchu Vishnu who was convincing as a good actor to lead the role as Thinnadu/Kannappa. Maybe it's the prejudice against the controversial behaviour he had over the years that has negarively impacted people's view of him as an actor. I think a movie is supposed to be watched for entertainment and not based on these predetermined biases that affect the livelihood of so many people who worked hard for this film.
9,"You are given a platform to make a movie. You have a producer who will give you any amount of money, you got actors who will do exactly what you say. Then how did you failed this miserably. Dear Telugu directors and actors, Rajamouli alone cannot save your industry, you people have to up your game. Dont shove whatever you are cooking in the name of cinema to the audience. Be responsible. You are making a art. Dont just stick to one template for decades. Telugu cinama is lucky to get Oscar and Pan world reach but dont take it for granted. Please give me my money back not just tickets but also also for those expensive water and sandwiches."
10,"Not worth👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻. 99% of the audience are Prabhas fans and that 20 mins of Prabhas screen presence is good other than that nothing great. Not a great writing, direction and screen play. The budget they put to make this movie is not justified at all. First half of the movie is not even worth 5 mins. Last 20mins of the movie is okay"
11,"Loved the movie for storyline, acting and the tribal pulchritude. It is important for the audience to understand that bringing stories from Puranas to mainstream movies is quite tricky, and this is a great attempt. May they make a lot more such movies, and may the quality keep improving."
12,"Location is the king in this film - Never shown angles and spots as this historical drama was filmed in wonderful New Zealand. Actor and producer Vishnu Manchu opines New Zealand is ""last painting of God"". Around 80% of the film was shot in New Zealand locations of Auckland, Rotorua, Glenorchy, Wanaka, Pukaki, and Christchurch."
13,"Despite big names like Prabhas and several cameo appearances, the film fails to impress. The choreography lacked impact, and the story narration felt disjointed with no emotional depth or standout moments. Cameos seemed forced and underutilized, adding little to the plot. Even Prabhas's role was not well-developed, missing the powerful presence he's known for. Weak presentation, poor pacing, and inconsistent visuals further hurt the experience. Overall, it was a disappointing watch, earning just 4 out of 10-saved only by the excitement of the cameo characters. It's better for a call to manchu family can stop acting in the movies and start the production to make better career in the industry."
